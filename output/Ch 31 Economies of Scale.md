## What are Economies of Scale?

**What are Economies of Scale?** Economies of scale are the reduction in average costs per unit that a firm benefits from as a result of increasing the scale of their business. Large firms gain advantages from economies of scale that smaller firms do not. This gives large businesses a competitive advantage.

As output increases so the long run average costs of the firm fall until the business becomes so big that LRACs begin to rise and diseconomies occur.

## Types of Economies of Scale

**Types of Economies of Scale** 

Economies of scale can be categorised as either internal economies or external economies. An internal economy of scale is a benefit that a company receives from an increase in their size leading to a reduction in their average cost per unit. An external economy is the advantages of scale that benefit an entire industry and not just an individual business.

## Internal Economies of Scale

**Internal Economies of Scale** 

You need to learn about 5 different types of economy of scale for your examination: 

### Bulk Buying (Purchasing)

**Bulk Buying (Purchasing)** 

Commonly known as a purchasing economy of scale, bulk buying is the benefit that a business receives from purchasing large volumes of a good. The supplier is incentivised to offer a discount as the scale of the purchase is substantial. The lower costs allow a business to either lower their selling prices to consumers (increasing competitiveness) or maximise their profits (benefiting shareholders)

### Financial Economies

**Financial Economies** 

As a business grows in scale so they acquire more assets. Assets can be used as security against any kind of financial borrowing. This reduces the risk for the lender. With a lower level of risk, lenders are prepared to offer larger businesses more money and a much more favourable lending rate than smaller firms.

### Technical Economies

**Technical Economies** 

To enable growth, a business is more likely to increase levels of production and productivity by making greater use of capital equipment. The automation of production lines offers cost savings as more can be produced with less waste and greater efficiency than using human capital. Drawbacks of this approach include job losses, lower staff motivation and the high initial cost of investment in equipment.

### Marketing Economies

**Marketing Economies** 

Increasing growth brings with it the need for additional marketing and promotional campaigns. An increased scale of production means that marketing costs are now spread out over more units of output, therefore reducing the average costs of marketing.

### Managerial Economies

**Managerial Economies** 

R&D is NOT the same thing as market research but research can inform decisions. As a sole trader, a business owner would be expected to carry out all tasks to keep the business afloat. The business owner would be responsible for marketing, production, sales, finance, HR and logistics. As the business grows in size, so the levels of hierarchy within the business increase and they employ specialists (experts) in each field e.g. HR Manager, Sales Manager etc. The specialists make far fewer mistakes and this means lower costs which brings about managerial economies of scale.

## External Economies of Scale

**External Economies of Scale** 

External economies help to partially explain the reasons as to why firms within the same industry cluster geographically near one another e.g. aeronautical engineering industries in the SW of England, financial services in London. The advantages that a firm can gain as a result of the growth of the industry – normally associated with a particular geographical area.

Output Costs

The LRAC curve of the entire industry shifts downwards to reflect the lower costs enjoyed by all firms in that industry.

### Educational Economies

**Educational Economies** 

Local colleges and universities assist with the development of a skilled labour force for the industry. Colleges offer relevant skills based courses and development research capabilities are improved at the universities. E.g. College Engineering Courses

### Supplier Economies

**Supplier Economies** 

Whilst educational external economies help provide the industry in an area with a ready made supply of skilled labour, component suppliers also make changes that benefit all firms. Suppliers will look to relocate themselves closer to the industry so as to reduce their transport costs and to improve their responsiveness to industry demands. With a close proximity to reliable sources of supplies, the industry is often able to exploit stock management and other cost benefits from just-in-time systems.

### Infrastructure Economies

**Infrastructure Economies** 

The concentration of an industry and suppliers within a certain geographical area will also encourage the development of the local infrastructure. It might result in: 

- Improved road networks 
- Better rail and port links 
- Faster broadband services 
- Improved telecommunications 

All of these features will help lower the operating costs of the entire industry through increased levels of efficiency.

## Diseconomies of Scale

**Diseconomies of Scale** 

Eventually as a business continues to increase their scale of operations, their LRAC curve will start to show a rise in costs. These increases in average costs are known as diseconomies of scale and occur as a result of growing inefficiencies brought about because of a difficulty in controlling the large size of the business. The 3 main examples of diseconomies are: 

- Co-ordination 
- Communication 
- Motivation

### Co-Ordination Diseconomies

**Co-Ordination Diseconomies** 

As a business grows in size, different working practices are used and people are now spread out across different locations (sometimes globally). This makes it increasingly difficult for management to monitor all activities of the business and to ensure that corporate objectives are being followed. As mistakes start to occur, so costs of reworking and corrective action increase and this leads to a rise in the LRACs.

### Communication Diseconomies

**Communication Diseconomies** 

Whilst a business remained as an SME, the owners were able to relatively easily speak with all staff on a regular basis. As a business grows, so too do the levels of hierarchy, the number of staff and the number of branches. This makes it much harder for all staff to be communicated with effectively and messages get lost. This can lead to some staff not understanding their role within the organisation or following different objectives to those of the company. Such actions lead to lower levels of productivity and a rise in LRACs.

### Motivational Diseconomies

**Motivational Diseconomies** 

As a result of a combination of poor co-ordination and communication, employees can quickly become demotivated. Poor motivation will lead to lower levels of productivity and production which will raise costs and make a firm less competitive within the market.

## Are Diseconomies Inevitable?

**Are Diseconomies Inevitable?** 

Diseconomies are a common problem for large businesses but with careful planning ahead their impact can be minimised. Examples: 

- Improve communication systems e.g. develop an intranet, newsletter, weekly briefings… 
- Improve motivation through team building activities. 
- Improve co-ordination through better training and empowerment of local management. 
- Positive reinforcement of vision statement.

## Why Do Small Firms Survive?

**Why Do Small Firms Survive?** 

SMEs do not benefit from economies of scale in the same way as their larger rivals. This means that they are less efficient and have higher costs! Many small firms do not survive but how is it that some do? 

- Greater flexibility to change to meet customer demands 
- Quality product and service so they can charge premium prices. 
- Some markets are too small to be of interest to larger businesses.
