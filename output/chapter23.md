# Added Value

**Added Value** is a concept in business that is covered in WJEC/ Eduqas Business A Level Component One: Business Functions.

## What is Added Value?

**Added value** is the process of increasing the worth of a resource by modifying it in some way. This results in the value of the final product being worth more than the sum of its individual parts. Value can be added to both goods and services.

## Added Value Formula

The **Added Value Formula** is calculated by subtracting the value (cost) of inputs from the value of output. It is important to note that added value should not be confused with profit. Profit takes into account all of the costs involved in the process of adding value, not simply the difference between raw material cost and selling price.

## Worked Example

Here is a **worked example** of the added value formula in action:

**INPUTS**

- Wood £150
- Fixtures & Fittings £5
- Glue £2
- Varnish £10

**PROCESSES**

- Labour
- Sanding
- Varnishing
- Polishing
- Construction

**OUTPUT**

- Finished Table £650

**ADDING VALUE**

Value of Output – Value of Inputs

**OUTPUTS**

- £650
- £167

**VALUE ADDED**

= £650 - £167 = £483

## Ways of Increasing Added Value

There are several ways to increase added value:

### Improving Lead Times

Customers perceive a direct correlation between speed and the value of a product or service. Customers are often willing to pay a premium price for faster delivery or manufacturing lead times. However, the extra speed must not be delivered at the expense of product quality.

### Raise Selling Prices

One option is to simply increase the selling price and widen the monetary gap between the inputs and outputs. However, the success of this strategy depends upon the price elasticity value of a product or service. An item with a highly price elastic value will see a substantial decline in sales if the selling price is raised, resulting in a fall in sales revenue.

### Reduce Costs

A business might try to add value by reducing the price paid for their inputs (raw materials). However, such a strategy must take into account the overall objectives of the business. For example, a business known for their quality is likely to face criticism and lost sales if they change to cheaper materials. Changing suppliers is also a high-risk strategy as it takes time to establish a new relationship with a supplier who understands the specific needs of your business.

### Branding

Branding provides a business with a means of differentiating their goods or services. Premium brands are able to sell their goods for a significantly higher price. Production costs of luxury perfumes are not much higher than lower cost alternatives, but the added value is a lot more.

### Convenience

Increasing customer convenience can also help to add value. A good example is the fast food industry. Fast food chains have numerous branches across towns, saving customers the inconvenience of driving around to find a store. Home delivery services are an extension of convenience strategies and add value as higher prices can be charged. Supermarkets are also becoming more convenient.

## Final Evaluation

Added value does not always guarantee a high enough level of profit to sustain a business. The processes involved in the manufacturing (transformation phase) of production might be very high, such as the need for highly skilled staff. Added value helps a firm to differentiate their goods and services, which can protect their market share from rival competitors.
