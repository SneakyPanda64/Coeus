# Added Value

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:
- Explain what is meant by added value
- Calculate added value
- Explain ways of increasing value added
- Evaluate the importance of added value to a business and its stakeholders.

## What is Added Value?

Added value is the process of increasing the worth of a resource by modifying it in some way. As a result, the value of the final product is worth more than the sum of its individual parts. Value can be added to both goods and services.

## Added Value Formula

Added Value Formula: Value of Output – Value (Cost) of Inputs

Exam Tip: Do not make the mistake of confusing added value with profit. Profit takes into account all of the costs involved in the process of adding value, not simply the difference between raw material cost and selling price, e.g. the price of a carpenter’s wages for sanding a table.

## Worked Example

INPUTS | PROCESSES | OUTPUT
--- | --- | ---
Wood £150 | Labour | Finished Table £650
Fixtures & Fittings £5 | Sanding | 
Glue £2 | Varnishing | 
Varnish £10 | Polishing | 
 | Construction | 
OUTPUTS |  | 
£650 |  | 
INPUTS |  | 
£167 |  | 
VALUE ADDED = £650-£167 = £483

## Ways of Increasing Added Value

### Improving Lead Times

Customers perceive a direct correlation between speed and the value of your product or service. Customers are often willing to pay a premium price for faster delivery or manufacturing lead times. The extra speed, however, must not be delivered at the expense of product quality! Firms who can rapidly fulfill orders fast are considered to be better and more competent, offering a higher level of quality than a business who does it slowly, or whenever they get around to it.

### Raise Selling Prices

One option is to simply increase the selling price and widen the monetary gap between the inputs and outputs. However, the success of this strategy depends upon the price elasticity value of a product or service. An item with a highly price elastic value will see a substantial decline in sales if the selling price is raised, and this will mean a fall in sales revenue.

Quantity | Price | P | P1 | Q1 | Q
--- | --- | --- | --- | --- | ---
Even a small rise in price brings about a large drop in quantity sold for a price elastic good.

### Reduce Costs

A business might try to add value by reducing the price paid for their inputs (raw materials). Such a strategy must take into account the overall objectives of the business, e.g. a business known for their quality is likely to face criticism and lost sales if they change to cheaper materials. Changing suppliers is also a high-risk strategy as it takes time to establish a new relationship with a supplier who understands the specific needs of your business.

### Branding

Branding provides a business with a means of differentiating their good or service. Premium brands are able to sell their goods for a significantly higher price. Production costs of luxury perfumes are not very much higher than lower cost alternatives, but the added value is a lot more. Right out of the perfume factory, the scent in its packaging costs €4; the perfume itself = €0.75. With a selling price of €50, the added value is €46 per 100ml bottle. Profit is much lower at less than €15 a bottle after accounting for promotion and distribution.

### Convenience

Increasing customer convenience can also help to add value with a good example being the fast food industry. Fast food chains have numerous branches across towns, saving customers the inconvenience of driving about to find a store. Home delivery services are an extension of convenience strategies and add value as higher prices are able to be charged. Supermarkets are also becoming more convenient.

## Final Evaluation

Added value does not always guarantee a high enough level of profit to sustain a business. The processes involved in the manufacturing (transformation phase) of production might be very high, e.g. the need for highly skilled staff. Added value helps a firm to differentiate their goods and services, which can protect their market share from rival competitors.
