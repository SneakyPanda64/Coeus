# Ch 25 Productivity

## What is Productivity?

Productivity is a measure of the **ratio of output to inputs** used in a production process, i.e. output per unit of input. The most common measure of productivity used by a business is that of **labour productivity**.

## Labour Productivity

Labour productivity is a measure of the **output per worker over a given period of time**.

**FORMULA**

Labour Productivity = Output (per period) / Number of employees (per period)

## Why is Productivity Important?

Productivity is a key factor in helping a business to grow. The more that an employee is able to produce in a given time period, the more productive they are. A high level of productivity helps a business to **reduce their costs** as more can be made with fewer resources. Lower costs help a business to **remain competitive** and at the same time this also allows higher wages to be paid.

## UK Productivity

When comparing the UK’s labour productivity levels against those of its main economic rivals in the G7, there is a general downward trend. The OECD accredit this decline to a **lack of innovation** and a failure to build upon the growth experienced in the early 1990’s following the **ICT revolution**. The UK has found it increasingly difficult to compete with their international rivals in terms of labour productivity meaning that they have **lost out on trade** due to higher labour costs.

UK productivity levels compare poorly against other members of the G7. The OECD identify that it takes a British worker 5 days to produce what a German could make in just 4 days. The North of the UK is **far less productive** than the South. Up to a quarter of UK employees hold **low skilled jobs** which is harmful to UK productivity.

## Improving Labour Productivity

### Staff Training

Labour productivity levels can be significantly improved through staff training. By improving the skills of employees they are able to produce more units of output. Staff will also be more **motivated** with training being recognised as a motivator by Herzberg.

### Capital Equipment

Human capital on its own is only capable of working so hard and producing a **limited number of units** in a given time. Investment in capital equipment provides the means of producing more units, efficiently and relatively cheaply. Capital equipment can support human capital (even in job production systems) e.g. the use of power snips to cut metal faster does not detract from a firm’s claim of ‘man made’.

### Financial Incentives

Providing direct financial incentives can encourage employees to increase their output. However, the benefits of an increased level of output can be easily cancelled out by a loss of quality as work is rushed. To be effective, financial incentives need to be linked to quality as well as quantity.

### Optimise Facilities

The introduction of **lean production** can improve labour productivity levels through the elimination of waste. A workplace can also be better organised in order to optimise production and productivity levels e.g. cell production or the increased use of automation.

## Adverse Impacts on Productivity

## Evaluation of Productivity

High levels of productivity enable a firm to **lower costs** and therefore improve their competitiveness. UK firms trail behind many other nations in terms of high levels of labour productivity which makes them **less attractive to foreign investors**. Improving productivity levels might mean short-term **job losses** through the increased use of technology and automation. However, this might secure a long-term future!

## What is Capacity Utilisation?

Capacity is the maximum number of units that a firm can actually produce with existing resources. Capacity utilisation is the relationship between the output that is produced with the existing resources, and the potential output which could be produced with it, if capacity was fully used.

**FORMULA**

Actual Output x 100 / Maximum Possible Output

## Worked Example

Hull City football club’s stadium can accommodate 25,500 fans on match days. For its match against Norwich City, the club sell 17,801 tickets. What is their capacity utilisation?

17,801 x 100 = 69.81%
25,500

With a capacity utilisation of 69.81% the football club still has to pay costs such as rent, salaries, wages, food and cleaning. The lower the capacity utilisation figure, the fewer units these costs can be spread out over.

## Problems with Spare Capacity

Fear of redundancy and job losses as a business seeks to lower their costs. Equipment risks becoming outdated. If capacity utilisation is lower than 90% then assets are said to be under-utilised. This means that they are not being used efficiently.

## Improving Capacity Utilisation

### Subcontracting Production

If a business has very low capacity utilisation, then it might make more sense to pay another firm to make the products for them.

### Rationalisation

Another technique for improving a firm’s capacity utilisation is to rationalise. Rationalisation is the process of ‘shrinking’ or reducing the operational size of a business. This can be achieved through the sale of under-utilised assets so that means the remaining assets actually work harder, increasing the capacity utilisation figure as the same is being produced with fewer resources. Customers might be lost as the business perhaps now offer fewer products. Job losses might also occur so redundancy costs have to be paid.

### Increase Asset Use

Any of these techniques might help a business to sell more and therefore to make better use of their existing resources. Drawbacks include the additional costs of research, product development and promotional activity. Sales promotions also must consider price and income elasticity!
