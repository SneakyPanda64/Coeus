# Production

This passage discusses the different aspects of production in business, including operations management, the size and nature of firms, the impact of technology and labor, and different production methods such as job production, batch production, and flow (mass) production.

## Operations Management

Every firm has an operations function. The goal of most firms involves the production of **goods and/or services**. They need to purchase resources, convert them into outputs and distribute them to the end users. Operations embraces all the activities required to create and deliver a firm’s goods or services to its customers or clients.

## What is Production?

Production is the process by which inputs (resources) are transformed into outputs in the form of a useful product or service. 

Example:

| INPUTS | TRANSFORMATION PROCESS | OUTPUTS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hops | Brewing | Beer |
| Barley | Fermentation |  |
| Yeast |  |  |
| Water |  |  |
| Malt |  |  |

## Size and Nature of Firms

The size of a business will often determine the manufacturing methods that they will employ. The larger a business is, the more finance they have available to invest in **capital and mass production techniques**. Bigger businesses also have a **larger customer base** that need products to be readily available. Smaller firms are more likely to better understand the **individual needs** of their customers and are therefore more frequent users of small-scale manufacturing techniques such as **job and batch production**.

## Impact of Technology

The improvements in modern technology have meant that customers, retailers, and manufacturers all have developed far closer relationships. One of the main developments in operations has been the growth of **mass customization**. This is where mass-produced goods are adapted to meet the individual needs of customers.

### Mass Customisation

Mass customization makes use of flexible **computer-aided manufacturing** technology. This combines the benefits of low-cost mass production with the customisation of products that better meet customer needs. This can provide a business with a **competitive advantage** and adds value.

## Impact of Labor

The skill set of a firm’s labor force is a key consideration in the methods of production used. For a firm that produces small-scale, bespoke items that meet the individual needs of customers, **higher skilled staff** are employed. Such skills are **expensive to employ** and develop further through training but firms are able to **charge a premium price** for the final product or service provided.

Firms that utilize mass-production (flow production) techniques **do not usually require highly skilled staff**. Operatives are needed to monitor and assist on the production lines but craft or specialist skills are far less necessary. Employees working in mass production industries are often **cheaper to employ**.

## Production Methods

There are different production methods that businesses can use, including job production, batch production, and flow (mass) production.

### Job Production

Job production involves the manufacture or delivery of **one-off or a small number of items**. Customers are able to **specify their exact requirements** and it normally is a **labor-intensive** method. Usually, this is associated with small-scale businesses who **specialize** in a particular area and use **skilled employees**.

Examples: 

- Watch makers
- Architects
- Hair Stylists
- Surgeons
- Artists
- Sculptors
- Tailors

### Batch Production

This involves the production of **small quantities of identical products** – a batch. Each batch goes through several stages. Clothes manufacturers use batch production to produce a given item, such as a jacket, in batches of different sizes or colors. All of the items in the batch are the same, so production is speeded up. This reduces the cost of labor and results in the final product being **less expensive** for the customer.

Examples:

- Bakeries
- Paints
- Sports Shoes
- Ink production
- Adhesives
- Water purification

### Flow (Mass) Production

This is a **continuous process** where products flow freely from one stage to the next without delay. It enables **large volumes of identical products** to be manufactured. Production is broken down into several smaller stages which enable the use of specialist robotics to speed up production and shorten lead-times.

Examples:

- Car Assembly Plants
- Chocolate Goods
- Soft Drinks
- Mobile phones
- Electronic goods
- Oil refineries

## Final Evaluation

The type of production method used by a business depends upon some of the following factors:

- The size of the business
- The nature of the product or service
- The skill set of the labor force
- The cost of production
- The demand for the product or service
