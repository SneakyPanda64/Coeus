# Production

This is a passage about production in business, specifically in the context of WJEC/Eduqas Business A Level Component One: Business Functions.

## Learning Objectives

By the end of this topic, you should be able to:

- Understand the nature of operations management in different types of business organization
- Explain the different methods of production, including job, batch, and flow
- Evaluate appropriate methods of production for businesses

## Operations Management

Every firm has an operations function. The goal of most firms involves the production of goods and/or services. They need to purchase resources, convert them into outputs, and distribute them to the end-users. Operations embrace all the activities required to create and deliver a firm’s goods or services to its customers or clients.

## What is Production?

Production is the process by which inputs (resources) are transformed into outputs in the form of a useful product or service.

Example:

| INPUTS | TRANSFORMATION PROCESS | OUTPUTS |
| --- | --- | --- |
| Hops | Brewing and Fermentation | Beer |
| Barley |  |  |
| Yeast |  |  |
| Water |  |  |
| Malt |  |  |

## Size and Nature of Firms

The size of a business will often determine the manufacturing methods that they will employ. The larger a business is, the more finance they have available to invest in capital and mass production techniques. Bigger businesses also have a larger customer base that needs products to be readily available. Smaller firms are more likely to better understand the individual needs of their customers and are therefore more frequent users of small-scale manufacturing techniques such as job and batch production.

## Impact of Technology

The improvements in modern technology have meant that customers, retailers, and manufacturers all have developed far closer relationships. One of the main developments in operations has been the growth of mass customization. This is where mass-produced goods are adapted to meet the individual needs of customers.

### Mass Production vs Customization

## Mass Customization

Mass customization makes use of flexible computer-aided manufacturing technology. This combines the benefits of low-cost mass production with the customization of products that better meet customer needs. This can provide a business with a competitive advantage and adds value.

## Impact of Labor

The skill set of a firm’s labor force is a key consideration in the methods of production used. For a firm that produces small-scale, bespoke items that meet the individual needs of customers, higher skilled staff are employed. Such skills are expensive to employ and develop further through training, but firms are able to charge a premium price for the final product or service provided.

Firms that utilize mass-production (flow production) techniques do not usually require highly skilled staff. Operatives are needed to monitor and assist on the production lines, but craft or specialist skills are far less necessary. Employees working in mass production industries are often cheaper to employ.

## Job Production

Job production involves the manufacture or delivery of one-off or a small number of items. Customers are able to specify their exact requirements, and it normally is a labor-intensive method. Usually, this is associated with small-scale businesses who specialize in a particular area and use skilled employees. Kate’s wedding dress was a one-off creation.

### Job Production Examples

- Watch makers
- Architects
- Hair Stylists
- Surgeons
- Artists
- Sculptors
- Tailors

## Batch Production

This involves the production of small quantities of identical products – a batch. Each batch goes through several stages. Clothes manufacturers use batch production to produce a given item, such as a jacket, in batches of different sizes or colors. All of the items in the batch are the same, so production is sped up. This reduces the cost of labor and results in the final product being less expensive for the customer.

### Batch Production Examples

- Bakeries
- Paints
- Sports Shoes
- Ink production
- Adhesives
- Water purification

## Flow (Mass) Production

This is a continuous process where products flow freely from one stage to the next without delay. It enables large volumes of identical products to be manufactured. Production is broken down into several smaller stages which enable the use of specialist robotics to speed up production and shorten lead-times.

### Flow Production Examples

- Car Assembly Plants
- Chocolate Goods
- Soft Drinks
- Mobile phones
- Electronic goods
- Oil refineries

## Final Evaluation

The type of production method used by a business depends upon some of the following factors:

- Economies of scale
- Bespoke production
- Mass customization
- Drawbacks of using batch production techniques
- Impact upon stakeholders of each of the different production methods

## Quick Fire Five

- State the manufacturing method that is the most appropriate for the production of bespoke jewelry.
- State the meaning of the term ‘mass customization’.
- State 2 drawbacks of using batch production techniques.
- Examine the impact upon stakeholders of each of the different production methods.
