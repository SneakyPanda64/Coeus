# Chapter 20: Motivation

Motivation theory looks at different ways to get the best work from employees. Good motivation makes workers want to do their job well and be loyal to their employer. There are different ideas and theories about how to motivate workers, including:

- Taylor's scientific management
- Mayo's Hawthorne experiments
- Maslow's hierarchy of needs
- Herzberg's two-factor theory
- Vroom, Porter, and Lawler's expectancy theories

## Scientific Management

Scientific management is a task-oriented approach to managing workers where they are paid for specific tasks and output produced, not for thinking. Taylor believed that workers should not have to think and should just do their job. He also believed that the most efficient workers' methods should be used by all workers. Scientific management was successful in increasing productivity and was used by Henry Ford and others. However, it may not be the only key to success as quality is now more important. Nonetheless, it is still used in labor-intensive industries where costs need to be kept to a minimum.

## Human Relations School

Elton Mayo and his team did a study at a factory and found that group dynamics were more important than money in how well people worked. They found that people worked better when they felt valued and recognized. Mayo suggested that communication, teamwork, and involving others in decision-making were important for motivation. This led to the Human Relations School of management, which sees workers and managers as interacting groups. Communication is now seen as important.

## Maslow's Hierarchy of Needs

Maslow's hierarchy is a pyramid that shows different types of needs people have, starting with basic needs like food and safety, then moving up to social needs, self-esteem needs, and finally self-actualization. The needs are divided into five levels: 

1. Basic needs
2. Safety needs
3. Love and belonging
4. Esteem needs
5. Self-actualization

To satisfy these needs, employers must provide a living wage, good working conditions, job security, and benefits like sick pay and pensions. Managers should also offer positive communication, bonuses, and opportunities for personal growth to help employees feel good about their achievements and reach their personal goals.

## Herzberg's Two-Factor Theory

Herzberg's research found that there are things that can make workers happy, called "motivators," and things that can make them unhappy, called "hygiene factors." Managers need to make sure that the hygiene factors are taken care of before they can focus on motivating their workers. Some examples of motivators are recognition, opportunities for promotion, and achieving goals. Some examples of hygiene factors are poor working conditions, lack of job security, and unsatisfactory wages.

## Vroom's Expectancy Theory

Vroom's expectancy theory suggests that people act in their own best interests and will undertake a task if they believe they will receive a worthwhile reward. The reward does not have to be monetary and can vary depending on the individual. There are three important aspects of motivation: valence, instrumentality, and expectancy. Valence can be positive or negative depending on whether the expected outcome is favorable or not. Instrumentality means that an individual needs to believe that a particular action will lead to a particular result. Expectancy is the individual's belief in the likelihood of achieving the target set for them. The motivation of an individual is a combination of these three forces. The reward an individual expects to receive for completing a task also affects their motivation, and it can be intrinsic or extrinsic.

## Payment Methods

Workers are often motivated to achieve speed of output rather than quality of output, and wages are paid hourly. However, a minimum wage may not provide a decent standard of living. Salaried workers are paid at an annual rate and receive their income monthly, which is good for businesses' cash flow. Profit-related pay links part of an employee's income to the profits of a company, but it is mostly applied to senior management. Some businesses have schemes that allow all employees to share in company profits.

## Motivating Workers

Job enrichment means giving workers interesting tasks to do, which makes them more committed to achieving quality. Job enlargement means increasing the number of tasks a worker does, while job rotation means changing tasks regularly to reduce boredom. Jobs should be challenging and allow decision-making. Communication, empowerment, quality circles, training, and flexible working are other ways to motivate workers.

## Conclusion

When all workers are treated equally, it's called a single status workplace. However, there are problems with using non-financial methods of motivation, such as the cost and the existence of managers who don't see the value in it. Also, external factors like a recession can make it hard to motivate workers. However, effective motivation can lead to benefits like increased productivity, quality, and worker satisfaction.
